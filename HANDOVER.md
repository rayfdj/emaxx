# Resume the full compact-runtime goal here

The goal is **active and incomplete**. Read the [complete goal and all completion
requirements](docs/runtime-representation-goal.md) and the
[locked performance contract](docs/core-runtime-performance-contract.md) before
editing. A validated checkpoint, green gate or handover does not complete it.
Current user instructions take precedence over historical notes.

This file holds only the current state and the next steps. Every earlier
checkpoint, failure, diagnosis, draft and evidence link is preserved verbatim in
the [15 October archive](docs/runtime-representation-handover-history-2026-10-15.md)
(and, before that, the [1 October archive](docs/runtime-representation-handover-history-2026-10-01.md)).
The [requirement map](docs/runtime-representation-progress.md) tracks the full
scope; the [accounting continuation](docs/runtime-representation-accounting-draft.md)
records the GNU counter contract.

## Where things stand — 15 October 2026

| State | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| **Main** `94295d0a` | Source324: one-word values, 16-byte cons payloads, shared object work, and symbol value/function/plist/flags on the allocated symbols. |
| **[PR87](https://github.com/rayfdj/emaxx/pull/87)** `35c6cd9b` (`runtime-char-tables`) | Object-state draft17: membership, constants, aliases, same-name replacement, image restoration and native `nil`/`t` identity. 584 runtime inputs. |
| **Task branch** `claude/awesome-newton-yk6sae` | Stacked on PR87: allocation counters, forwarded counter variables and actual header charges (below). |

**PR87 evidence in this repository:** strict checks with zero warnings, 407
affected controls in each of gate and release, and 44 ordinary GNU comparisons /
88 processes (see the archive's 13 October section). Its three Linux CI runs on
the PR head are green.

**PR87 results reported by the previous session, whose raw evidence is on the
macOS host and not in this repository:** full Linux Rust 3,200 passes and macOS
Rust 3,188 passes (two existing ignores each); Linux frozen all 519 files /
7,928 outcomes; three Linux pilots at about 2.73× GNU (geometric mean) and
1.33% slower than main; macOS frozen 318 files / 4,479 matches before both
Tramp timeouts, with 200 files unrun; the 226 terminal scenarios not yet run.
Record the raw evidence with the merge.

**To merge PR87** (macOS host): the Tramp observation with the established
600-second bound, the exact remaining 200 macOS frozen files, all 226 terminal
scenarios, an audit of the results, and the published evidence. Existing
approval covers task pushes, Linux CI and the main merge.

The previous session also held an unpushed local draft correcting the symbol
header charge (64 bytes charged as 48). The task branch implements that
correction independently (below); the local draft need not be recovered.

## Task branch: allocation counters and forwarded variables

GNU `alloc.c` raises seven process-wide counters at its allocation points and
exposes them as DEFVAR_INT variables. Previously Emaxx bound the seven names to
zero and `memory-use-counts` signalled "unavailable", which also blocked the
performance contract's allocation evidence.

- [`alloc/counters.rs`](src/lisp/alloc/counters.rs) holds the seven words.
  They are raised at the single allocation point of each kind: `allocate_cons`,
  `allocate_float`, `allocate_symbol`, `allocate_vectorlike` (the words asked
  for after the header, before block rounding) and ordinary non-empty
  `allocate_string` (one string plus its bytes). Pure and image-restored
  strings are not counted, as in GNU.
- The symbols forward to the words: `SymbolCell` gains an `INT_FORWARD` state
  whose payload is the counter (GNU's `Lisp_Intfwd`). Reads, stores, `let`
  bindings and image snapshots act on the counter. Stores keep the existing
  FWD_INT checks; `makunbound` makes the symbol plain while the counter keeps
  counting. Ordinary value reads pay one combined state test.
- After loading an image, the counters stand at the image's recorded values
  (pdumper's `dump_fwd_int`), not at those values plus the loader's rebuilding.
- Copying an editor's symbol graph copies the forwarding, not a frozen integer.
- `memory-use-counts` returns the seven counters.
- Symbol and string headers are charged at the actual 64- and 48-byte cells
  (GNU: 48 and 32), in the GC tally, live bytes and the `garbage-collect`
  report. The lower charges undercounted live bytes and delayed collection.

**Explicit differences that remain:** `intervals-consed` is never raised
because text properties are not yet allocated intervals. Vector cells count
Emaxx's actual vector-like sizes, so pseudovectors laid out differently from GNU
(bignums, hash tables and others) differ, and objects Emaxx keeps outside the
Lisp heap are not counted. The `garbage-collect` report shows 64/48 where GNU
shows 48/32. String data is still charged by GNU's `sdata` formula, not
measured.

**Validation so far:** pending; complete library, platform and frozen
validation is required before merging.

## How the work is split

- **Linux (cloud sessions):** build GNU 30.2 at `636f166c` locally with the
  configure options from
  `src/lisp/native_comp/generated_native_subrs_x86_64_unknown_linux_gnu.rs`
  (as `frozen-run.yml` does) and place it at `../emacs`. The native ABI table
  must match exactly. A local build's binary hash differs from the CI lock, so
  authoritative Linux Rust/frozen/timing results come from `frozen-run.yml`.
- **macOS host:** PR87's closing items, and macOS validation at milestones.

## Validation tiers (agreed 15 October 2026)

1. **Each draft:** `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo check --locked
   --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets
   --all-features -- -D warnings`, `git diff --check`, the affected controls in
   the gate profile (and release when the change is release-sensitive), and the
   affected ordinary GNU comparisons.
2. **Each checkpoint merge:** full Linux Rust and frozen runs through CI, plus
   Linux timing pilots.
3. **macOS frozen, terminal and Tramp:** at milestones, at the end, or when a
   change touches platform-specific code.

Rejected experiments get a short note and their patch; full evidence packages
are for merges, and raw samples may live in CI artifacts. Unfavorable results
and failures are still recorded.

## Next steps, in the agreed order

1. Merge PR87 after its macOS closing items; then validate and merge the
   counter branch.
2. **Performance, worst ratios first.** Upstream sorting (5.44×) and undo
   (5.50×), then the call path (interpreted 2.87×, bytecode 2.90×,
   bytecode-to-native 3.79×), then GC and the mapcar regression. Iterate with
   instruction counts (callgrind) on the locked workloads for both editors;
   timing pilots at merges. Remaining adapters that show up in profiles are
   fixed as performance work.
3. **Remaining architecture and ownership:** symbol host-name, buffer-local and
   function adapters; text-property intervals (also needed for
   `intervals-consed`); pure storage (check what the pinned GNU revision
   actually does first); public Rust ownership, multiple editors, descriptor
   lifetimes and reclamation; the September 21 audit findings.
4. **Final validation and calibrated performance** once, on the final source:
   full Linux/macOS gates and the native, module, dump, startup, thread and GC
   contracts; calibration (the GNU self-comparison must resolve) and the
   nine-round run on a quiet host; the final adversarial review.

## Remaining full-goal requirements

Shared compact object authority without remaining adapters; honest physical
accounting (string data, allocator overhead and capacity, intervals); preserved
survival and reclamation with sound public ownership; profile-driven VM/call
work; the final adversarial review; zero-warning Linux/macOS validation and
pinned compatibility; and the **locked 16-workload GNU performance criterion:
every workload's upper 95% bound at or below 1.03× GNU**, with calibration,
nine rounds and real allocation counters. No GNU-parity claim exists.
