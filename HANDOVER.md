# Resume the full compact-runtime goal here

The goal is **active and incomplete**. Read the [complete goal and all completion
requirements](docs/runtime-representation-goal.md) before editing. A validated
checkpoint, green gate or handover does not complete it. Current user instructions
take precedence over historical notes.

Read the [current cons continuation](docs/runtime-representation-cons-roots-draft.md),
[allocator continuation](docs/runtime-representation-vector-allocation-draft.md),
[shared-reader handover](docs/runtime-representation-shared-reader-draft.md),
[bytecode draft](docs/runtime-representation-bytecode-draft.md) and
[accounting continuation](docs/runtime-representation-accounting-draft.md).
The [requirement map](docs/runtime-representation-progress.md) tracks the full scope.

## Current production and candidate

The latest validated main checkpoint is **source174**, merge `21d20f0e` in
[PR #78](https://github.com/rayfdj/emaxx/pull/78). Its
[complete validation record](docs/runtime-representation-call-validation-complete.md)
remains separate from the unfinished task branch.

The task branch is **runtime-char-tables**, [draft PR #79](https://github.com/rayfdj/emaxx/pull/79).
Runtime **source204** was published as `d186d40bf014ca53d0a2652b4e2f2d921c5cb009`.
The subsequent task updates add diagnostic tooling and evidence; all **410 runtime
and test inputs** remain source204. The candidate combines the shared command
reader, authoritative keyboard-macro array/state, word-aligned vector allocation
and direct cons fields with GNU-compatible conservative cons-root validation.

## Source204 evidence and live work

- [Selected validation](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-cons-selected-validation-manifest.json):
  zero-warning strict checks, **596 gate / 596 release tests**, seven focused
  controls per profile, **39 ordinary batch comparisons and one terminal fixture**.
  The earlier purecopy batch attempt remains failed; the original fixture and
  expectations pass in the required interactive mode. Prior audit failures remain
  preserved.
- [Complete macOS Rust](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-macos-complete-rust-manifest.json):
  **3,059 passes**, two existing ignores, native artifact identity and all input
  hashes verified. Supervisor **43352 has exited**.
- [Complete terminal comparison](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-complete-terminal-manifest.json):
  **226 scenarios / 686 comparisons** (658 screen, 28 filesystem), unchanged
  inventories and all eight execution inputs verified. Supervisor **43354 has
  exited**. GNU matches source/native ABI but is not the frozen Darwin executable.
- [Complete Linux Rust failure](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-linux-rust-failure-manifest.json),
  run **36764911748**: **2,232 passes / two census failures**. Both original
  reclamation assertions pass. Each first census delta is 47 slots below expected;
  later deltas match. Four later groups and both Cargo stages did not run. The
  exact executable `6ea03c1a…` and image `85ebb975…` are retained. Cause and repair
  remain unestablished.
- [Exact-artifact diagnosis](https://github.com/rayfdj/emaxx/actions/runs/36770142335)
  completed: the selected pair and original 626-test primitives group reproduce
  both failures. Its [audited incomplete trace](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-exact-census-incomplete-manifest.json)
  shows a 41-element vector and four-field host record reclaimed on the second
  collection. The debugger then hits its startup-cleanup inventory limit, with no
  complete test verdict. The retaining root is not established. A revised observer
  captures the independent host conservative stack and limits cleanup tracing to
  collections 2..4. Its next Linux run still uses the same retained artifacts.
- [Complete Linux frozen comparison](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source204-linux-frozen-manifest.json),
  run **36764918696**, passes **519 files / 7,928 matching outcomes / 1,038
  successful processes** on exact runtime `d186d40b`. Per editor: 7,670 passes,
  47 expected failures and 211 skips; the latter are not passes.

Do not promote PR #79 while the census failures or complete candidate validation
remain unresolved. The preceding source201 passed full Rust, terminal and Linux
frozen gates; those results do not certify source204. Preserve all failed results,
unexecuted stages, expected failures, skips, and artifact/environment limits.

## Separate unfinished bytecode draft

**Source206** in `target/runtime-goal/recovered-2026-09-30/bytecode-closure/emaxx`
adds only tests/fixtures to unchanged runtime204. Its
[portable patch and negative controls](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source206-bytecode-negative-controls-manifest.json)
replay **416 inputs** from main `21d20f0e`. Fresh gate build succeeds: **one pass /
four failures**. Both layout controls and both code-string mutation controls fail;
constant sharing, cloning, GC and rejected closure `aset` pass. Supervisor
**51384 has exited**. No bytecode repair is applied to the task branch.

The bytecode closure still has detached 88-byte record/slot storage versus GNU's
40-byte four-slot closure. Mutating its code string is visible through Lisp but
execution uses stale decoded instructions, even during an active call. An
entry-only cache refresh cannot fix that case. The earlier
[source205 baseline](docs/handover/2026-09-30-shared-reader-draft/source205-bytecode-negative-baseline-manifest.json)
retains the original ordinary probes, including the invalid closure-aset attempt.

## Remaining full-goal requirements

Finish shared compact object authority (including bytecode closures and allocated
symbols), remove remaining adapters and unnecessary ordinary-path bookkeeping,
implement honest physical allocation/GC accounting and real counters, preserve
survival and reclamation, and complete VM/call optimization from profiles. The
final adversarial review, zero-warning Linux/macOS validation, pinned compatibility
and **locked 16-workload GNU performance criterion with its unchanged 3% ceiling**
remain required. No current timing or GNU-parity claim exists.

Receipts and reproduction helpers are under `target/runtime-goal/resume-2026-09-28`;
recovered checkouts and GNU are under `target/runtime-goal/recovered-2026-09-30`.
Rebuild on another machine; local executable/image identities are not portable
validation claims. Do not reapply historical patches over the existing task branch.

The [archived full continuation index](docs/runtime-representation-handover-history-2026-10-01.md)
retains every earlier checkpoint, failure, diagnosis and handover link. It includes
the original [27 September handover](docs/runtime-representation-handover.md) and
[complete September 21 audit](docs/adversarial-decheating-audit-2026-09-21.md).
