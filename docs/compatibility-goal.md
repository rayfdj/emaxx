# Compatibility Goal

This file records the active long-running goal so interrupted sessions can resume
from the same concrete state.

## Objective

Make `emaxx` 100% compatible with GNU Emacs at the Elisp API boundary by passing
the harness-selected GNU Emacs compatibility tests from the sibling checkout at
`../emacs`.

The canonical ordered manifest is:

- `compat/oracle_tests_all.txt`
- `compat/oracle_tests_all.md`

The denominator is 7080 selected tests. Do not use source-tree `ert-deftest`
counts as the progress denominator.

## Current State

- Tests through 464/7080 are verified locally.
- The latest compatibility batch is
  `Compat 464/7080: load customize widgets`.
- The 1..378 exact selected-test prefix was replayed after the
  `primitives.rs`/`eval.rs` split, after the SRecode/Semantic fixes, and again
  after the char-fold/regexp changes; all 378 passed. The same exact 1..378
  prefix was replayed again after the Completion Preview changes in the
  457/7080 batch; all 378 passed.
- Selectors 379..396 passed as a grouped Semantic IA replay after the
  char-fold/regexp changes. Selectors 397..407 passed as individual literal
  manifest selectors because `test/lisp/cedet/semantic-utest.el` is
  order-sensitive as a grouped run.
- Selectors 408..414 in `test/lisp/char-fold-tests.el` and selector 415
  `color-tests-cie-de2000` passed individually after adding Unicode
  decomposition support for char folding and the `time-to-seconds` time
  primitive.
- Selectors 416..446 passed individually after adding `color-values` and named
  color parsing for the existing color conversion path.
- Selectors 447..457 in `test/lisp/completion-preview-tests.el` passed
  individually after adding symbol bounds, `while-no-input`, pcase `seq`
  matching, mutable completion strings, and the completion metadata helpers
  needed by Completion Preview mode.
- Selectors 458..461 in `test/lisp/completion-tests.el` passed individually
  after adding the standard backup-retention defaults needed by
  `completion.el` and correcting `setcdr` to return the new cdr value.
- Selectors 462..463 in `test/lisp/completion-tests.el` passed individually
  after correcting regexp syntax-class translation for `\s ` and `\s_`.
- Selector 464, `cus-edit-test-bug63290` in `test/lisp/cus-edit-tests.el`,
  passed after loading real `cus-edit`, adding minimal widget accessors needed
  by `wid-edit`, and accepting marker positions in overlay range primitives.
- Selector 465, `cus-edit-tests-customize-apropos/hide-obsolete` in
  `test/lisp/cus-edit-tests.el`, is the next known failure.
- Resume compatibility advancement at test 465/7080 after pushing the 464
  batch.

## Workflow

1. Start from the next unverified ordered test in `compat/oracle_tests_all.txt`.
2. Continue forward until the first compatibility mismatch that requires a code
   fix.
3. Fix the behavior honestly in Rust. Do not hardcode test answers, delegate to
   oracle Emacs, or add compatibility shortcuts that only recognize test data.
4. Before committing for test N, run targeted regression coverage for tests
   1..N-1 that the change could affect. Broaden the coverage when the change
   touches shared evaluator, primitive, reader, buffer, process, or file I/O
   behavior.
5. Every code-change batch must pass:
   - `cargo fmt --check`
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo test`
   - `git diff --check`
   - relevant `compat-harness` runs
6. Commit and push each coherent passing batch before moving on.

## Notes From The 378 Batch

- `src/lisp/eval.rs` and `src/lisp/primitives.rs` were split into modules.
- All Rust files under `src/lisp/eval*` and `src/lisp/primitives*` are below
  3000 lines after the split.
- `test/lisp/calendar/todo-mode-tests.el` is order-sensitive as a full-file
  run. For the 1..378 verification, its 42 selected tests were verified as
  individual literal ERT selectors.
- `test/lisp/calc/calc-tests.el` passed with a longer timeout than the default
  short sweep timeout.
